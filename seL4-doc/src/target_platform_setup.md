# Target Platform Setup

The Avnet MaaXBoard is packaged in a small box with listed kit contents of 1 x MaaXBoard and 1 x Heat Sink Kit. Our boards came with the heat sink already attached; however, photographs of the board are often shown without the heat sink and it is conceivable that you may have to attach it yourself.

The following shows a plan view of the MaaxBoard with heat sink attached:

For clarity, not all of the components have been labelled, only those to which we are going to refer. Full hardware details are given in the [MaaXBoard Hardware User Manual](https://www.avnet.com/wps/wcm/connect/onesite/1e83cac7-ebe8-4be4-8776-6781e3833d11/MaaXBoard-Hardware_UserManual-V1.2-EN.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_NA5A1I41L0ICD0ABNDMDDG0000-1e83cac7-ebe8-4be4-8776-6781e3833d11-nVsEcIl).
