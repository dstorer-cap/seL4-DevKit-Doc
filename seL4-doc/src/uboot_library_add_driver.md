# Library Extension - New Driver

_This may not be the right structure. For now, just some markdown notes of content that will end up somewhere._

_Expect we need to cover to following:_
- Known problem: DMA
- Known problem: Live tree
- Talk about how to determine the required config macros. Look at .config generated by a build of u-boot.
- Guidance on how to identify the correct driver within U-Boot.

This section provides guidance on the addition of a new device driver to support a device on an existing platform.

Adding support for a new device can be broken down into logical steps:

1. [Identification of U-Boot Device Driver]()

2. [Updating the library `CMakeLists.txt` to support the device driver]()

3. [Associating the device driver with an existing platform]()

4. [Resolving compilation issues]()

5. [Updating an seL4 application to access the device]()

To further support this topic appendices have been added to provide [a worked example](./appendices/add_driver_worked_example.md) and to discuss [troubleshooting and common issues]() that may be encountered.

## Identification of U-Boot Device Driver

The first step in adding a new device driver to the library is to positively identify the U-Boot source file providing the required support.
